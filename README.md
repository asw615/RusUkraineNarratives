## Project Overview
This project investigates the narratives and discourses surrounding the Russo-Ukrainian War by analyzing four datasets:
1. **Russian news articles**
2. **Ukrainian news articles**
3. **Russian Telegram channels**
4. **Ukrainian Telegram channels**

Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF, Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), and sentiment analysis, we explored key themes, differences, and similarities in how the war is portrayed in Russian and Ukrainian media.

## Key Findings
- **Russian News Discourses**:
  - Focus on law, state, and national politics.
  - Emphasis on topics like American politics and diplomatic relations.
- **Ukrainian News Discourses**:
  - Focus on war events and battlefield developments.
  - Greater emphasis on terms related to survival and mobilization.
- **Russian Telegram Channels**:
  - Centered on the situational aspects of the war.
  - Generally more neutral and descriptive in tone.
- **Ukrainian Telegram Channels**:
  - More opinionated and demeaning language toward Russians.
  - Use of terms like "orcs" and "rashists" to describe Russians.

### Sentiment Analysis
- **General Sentiment Trends**:
  - Russian news showed a declining sentiment over time.
  - Ukrainian news had an upward sentiment trend, reflecting positive momentum in the conflict.
  - Telegram sentiment trends were more stable but reflected country-specific biases.

- **Aspect-Based Sentiment**:
  - Significant differences were observed in sentiments about key aspects like "forces," "situation," and "enemy" between the two sides.
